# CodeAlpha_HangmanGame
This project is a Hangman Game developed using Python. 
The objective of this project is to allow the user to guess a hidden word letter by letter within a limited number of attempts. 
A word is selected randomly from a predefined list, and a hint is provided to help the user guess the word. 
For each incorrect guess, the number of remaining attempts decreases. 
The game continues until the user successfully guesses the word or all attempts are exhausted. 
This project uses basic Python concepts such as loops, conditional statements, lists, strings, functions, and the random module. 
It is a console-based application designed for beginners to understand logical thinking and problem-solving using Python.
